Make OK for Public - Hide usernames, passwords, hostnames, IPs, (what else), in preparation of a gist or other sharing? [Maturity: New]

Usage
-----

Builds on top of ConradIrwin's `jist` gem, so that you can more safely gist
files that have sensitive information.

Be aware that this is in its infancy, but even when fully-grown, it will never
replace thinking. It's merely a tool to help you get a jumpstart on sanitizing
a file.

Currently Works With
--------------------

<%= actual_results %>

TODO
----

- IPv6 Addresses
- Hostnames
    - Dorky ISP-given ones that show IP addresses
- Make distinct (similar to an uglifier's symbol replacement)
  - first.host.name ⇒ hiddenhostname1
  - second.host.name ⇒ hiddenhostname2
